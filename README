The tools and documents here pertain to Athena Ruby, Dumbarton Oaks' font for publishing Byzantine inscriptions.

As of June 1, 2012, the font is in beta testing. Unofficial news, documentation, tools, and examples are provided here. This is also where the latest version of the font can be downloaded. As items on this page mature, they will be pushed to the official Dumbarton Oaks website: http://www.doaks.org/digital-humanities/publications/athena-ruby-inscription-font. A widespread, public announcement about the font will be made once a critical mass of support documents and tools are assembled.

You use the font, documentation, and ancillary tools at your own risk. At this early stage, users are assumed to understand how to install a font and how to play around with different types of text-processing software. You have a wonderful opportunity to help make Athena Ruby more useful to the community. Contribute to some of the documentation, tools, and examples below. Or create some new tools. If you have a comment or question, please send it to the group -- https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/athena-ruby -- not to any individual at Dumbarton Oaks.
