        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Athena Ruby is a comprehensive font for use in the scholarly publication of Byzantine
            inscriptions. It is an OpenType, Unicode-compliant font, and compatible with all major
            operating systems. Named after a predecessor font, Athena, and Dumbarton Oaks
            Publications Manager Glenn Ruby (d. 2004), Athena Ruby is designed to represent
            Byzantine inscriptions in Latin and Greek. The font has letters, letter variants,
            ligatures, and decoration found commonly in coins, seals, and weights, but not excluding
            other media, such as mosaics and frescoes. Glyphs are intended to represent letterforms
            found in the geographical area of the Byzantine empire, from approximately 325 to 1453.
            The font is suited to a broad range of print and digital publications, from simple,
            single-author projects to complex multiple-author ones. </p>

        <h2>Font Architecture</h2>
        <h3>Glyphs</h3>
        <p>The ca. 730 glyphs in Athena Ruby are intended to represent the major letterforms,
            punctuation, symbols, and decorations found in Byzantine inscriptions. It incorporates
            glyphs supported in older, non-Unicode fonts that Dumbarton Oaks developed from 1986
            through 2008, and introduces other Byzantine-era glyphs well attested in scholarly
            publications and in our collection. The characters were chosen with special attention to
            sigillography and numismatics, but also with reference to other disciplines. No claim is
            made that the ensemble of characters is comprehensive, or that it reflects the consensus
            in any given discipline.</p>
        <p>Athena Ruby has the Latin and Greek alphabets (normal forms, variants, ligatures);
            punctuation (modern and Byzantine); and symbols and decoration. To see a complete list
            of the glyphs, consult the database (<a href="ARdatabase.html">HTML</a> | <a
                href="AR.xml">XML</a>), which includes citations to published exmaples, or the <a
                href="AR ensemble.pdf">pdf presenting the ensemble of characters</a>. </p>
        <p>On the principle that the term <span class="term">minuscule</span> is anachronistic, the
            font has only uncial letterforms, bound to upper- and lowercase keystrokes.</p>
        <p>The only non-Byzantine glyphs allowed in the font are modern punctation marks &ndash; | ,
            . [ ] : Â· and the underdot.</p>
        <p>Athena Ruby has glyphs in the following tables (in Unicode sequence): Basic Latin (61
            points supported), Latin-1 Supplement (2 points), Spacing Modifier Letters (4 points),
            Combining Diacritical Marks (11 points), Greek and Coptic (49 points), Greek Extendend
            (167 points), General Punctuation (2 points), Number Forms (1 points), Geometric Shapes
            (1 points), Miscellaneous Symbols (1 points), Supplementary Punctuation (3 points),
            Ancient Greek Numbers (2 points). All other glyphs reside in the Private Use Area (PUA).
            Some characters in the PUA may become candidates for inclusion in Unicode. </p>
        <p>Supported codepoints: 0020-007C, 00A0, 00B7, 02C1, 02CA, 02CB, 02D9, 0300-03E1,
            1F00-1FFE, 200C, 200D, 2180, 25CC, 2627, 2E09, 2E0A, 2E23, E100-E823, 10182, 10184</p>
        <h3>OpenType Features</h3>
        <p>Athena Ruby is a True Type-flavor OpenType font. It utilizes several complex OpenType
            features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Character variants.</strong> Unicode can be thought of as a very long
                two-dimensional table. (See our <a
                    href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/publications/resources-for-authors-and-editors/guide-to-unicode-greek"
                    >Guide to Unicode Greek</a> for basic background on Unicode.) OpenType font
                technology allows type designers to assign numerous glyphs to any single Unicode
                point, thus adding something like a third dimension to the Unicode table. Athena
                Ruby employs this technique for letters with historically attested variant
                representations. The font has, for example, twenty-eight variants of the Greek
                alpha, each one bound to the proper Unicode point. Many software programs and
                contexts are not designed to acess Unicode-compliant variants. (That is, they can
                access Unicode only as a two-dimensional space.) For those instances, character
                variant glyphs are bound to suitable places in the private use area (PUA).</li>
            <li><strong>Contextual alternates.</strong> OpenType font technology allows for a glyph
                to change its form depending upon the context. Athena Ruby uses this technology, but
                only for overbars (U+0305), which change depending upon whether placed over a single
                letter or a ligature. Not all software programs will take advantage of this
                feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Discretionary ligatures.</strong> OpenType technology allows several ways to
                turn sequences of letters into ligatures that retain the underlying codepoint
                values. Athena Ruby uses discretionary ligatures, which are not turned on by
                default. These are accessed or permitted within application software. Note, too,
                that several of these ligatures have variants. One of them (U+0305) also has
                contextual alternates.</li>
            <li><strong>Stacking decorative elements in the PUA.</strong> Decorative elements in the
                PUA in the range U+E700..E758 are assigned specialized GPOS kerning values to allow
                the symbols to stack. To prevent nearby symbols from stacking, one may insert the
                zero width non-joiner (abbr. ZWNJ; U+200C).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To get the most out of Athena Ruby, you may need to choose a software program different
            from the one you are accustomed to using. Or you may need to modify the way you use a
            familiar program. To understand the limitations of specific software environments, and
            for recommendations on best practices, please see below, Editing with Athena Ruby.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p><a href="fonts/AthenaRuby_b017.ttf.zip" target="blank">Download Athena Ruby</a>. Go to
            the directory in which you saved the file and extract it. You do this usually by
            double-clicking on the file, or right-clicking on it and choose "expand" or "unpack".
            Find the newly unpacked font. The next step depends upon your operating system.</p>
        <p class="pc">Right click on the font and select Install. Alternatively, find the drive
            where you have your operating system installed and copy the file to /windows/fonts.</p>
        <p class="mac">Macintosh fonts are kept in multiple directories, and many Mac users manage
            their fonts with Fontbook (part of the OS) or a similar program. (Apple's website
            provides a good expalantion on <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2435">how to
                manage fonts on the Mac</a>.) Copy the uncompressed Athena Ruby file to the
            directory of your choice, and use your preferred font management program to install the
            font. If you don't know about font management programs, try double clicking on the file
            and then click "Install Font."</p>
        <p>Once Athena Ruby is installed, any open software programs will need to be restarted.</p>
        <h2>Entering text</h2>
        <p>To enter new text in Athena Ruby, use any of the methods below.</p>
        <h3>Just Start Typing: Keyboard Drivers</h3>
        <p>If you already know how to type in polytonic Greek, you are already set to use the font.
            If you do not, you should install a keyboard driver. </p>
        <p class="mac">Macintosh OS X includes a polytonic Greek keyboard driver as part of its
            standard operating system. Open <span class="instr">system preferences</span>, choose
                <span class="instr">language &amp; text</span>, then <span class="instr">input
                sources</span>. Choose <span class="instr">Greek Polytonic</span>. While there, you
            should make sure to turn on the <span class="instr">Keyboard &amp; Character
                Viewer</span>, good ways to find specific characters. Unfortunately, prior to OS
            10.4 (Tiger), polytonic Greek was not one of the options. For those on older versions of
            OS (and for those who run it, but are unhappy with the configuration of its polytonic
            Greek keyboard), a third-party driver in polytonic Greek should be installed. Try <a
                href="http://www.sourcecod.com/sophokeys">SophoKeys, a free keyboard driver</a>. A
            customized keyboard for Athena Ruby is currently under development.</p>
        <p class="pc">For Windows XP and Vista, there is a Polytonic Greek keyboard driver already
            built into the operating system, but you must activate it. Microsoft has provided <a
                href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651.aspx">very detailed
                instructions with pictures here</a>. Unfortunately, this driver's assignment of
            letters and diacriticals is difficult for many to memorize and use. Other Windows
            keyboards are <a
                href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~pinax/greekkeys/technicalDetails.html#alternative"
                >listed here</a>. Another alternative is <a
                href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/kal/multikey">MultiKey</a>, which is not a true
            universal keyboard driver, since it works only for Microsoft Word and Classical Text
            Editor. A customized keyboard for Athena Ruby is currently under development.</p>
        <h3>Pick and Choose: Character Finders and Palettes</h3>
        <p>Athena Ruby straddles several code tables in the Unicode standard: Latin, Greek, Greek
            Extended, Combining Diacritical Marks, and the Private Use Area. It will be helpful to
            have on hand a good palette or finder, to help you explore the font and get the
            characters you need. You will find this a helpful tool even if you are accustomed to
            typing with a keyboard driver.</p>
        <p class="pc">Windows operating systems have a small but powerful program called Character
            Map, which allows you to look through the contents of a font and copy the characters you
            want. Click the start or windows button, click <span class="instr">All Programs</span>
            then <span class="instr">xxx</span> then <span class="instr">yyy</span>. A similar but
            more powerful program is <a href="http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap.html"
                >Babel Map</a>.</p>
        <p class="mac">For OS 10.1-10.6 (for 10.7 and above see below), Mac's <span class="instr"
                >Character Viewer</span> and <span class="instr">Keyboard Viewer</span> are your
            best resources for navigating fonts. If you have a flag in the upper right corner of
            your screen, click on it and look for these features. If neither program is shown as an
            option, select <span class="instr">Open Language and Text...</span> and turn these
            features on. Or if you don't see a flag, open <span class="instr">system
                preferences</span>, choose <span class="instr">language &amp; text</span>, then
                <span class="instr">input sources</span>. The Character Viewer is powerful, and not
            all its features will be apparent at first. Try choosing different items in the <span
                class="instr">View</span> dropdown menu. Click some of the buttons that appear just
            below the <span class="instr">View</span> dropdown. Click the triangles beside <span
                class="instr">Character Info</span> and <span class="instr">Font Variation</span>.
            The <span class="instr">Character Viewer</span> for OS 10.7-10.8 is no help in finding
            glyphs in Athena Ruby. You will need to use a third-party application, such as <a
                href="http://www.fontexplorerx.com/">Linotype Fontexplorer</a> or <a
                href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/popcharx/">PopChar X</a>.</p>
        <p>Most character palettes access advanced glyphs exclusively through the PUA. That is, you
            won't get Unicode-compliant text if you use glyph finders to access ligatures and
            variant letterforms. </p>
        <p>Because the glyphs cover such a wide number of tables, quite separate from each other in
            the Unicode standard, a palette or glyph finder can be awkward to use. Users may find it
            more useful to use as palettes the character ensemble on the Dumbarton Oaks Athena Ruby
            website. Dowload the <a href="AR ensemble.docx.zip">Word</a>, <a
                href="AR ensemble.indd.zip">InDesign</a>, <a href="AR ensemble.pdf">PDF</a>, <a
                href="AR.xml">XML</a>, or <a href="ARdatabase.html">HTML</a> document, and simply
            copy the characters you want.</p>
        <p>A custom, web-based glyph finder for Athena Ruby is under development.</p>
        <h2>Editing with Athena Ruby</h2>
        <p>Athena Ruby is a complex font that uses advanced, specialized features in OpenType. The
            advanced features are too advanced, in fact, for the software most commonly used in
            2012, when the font was released. <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoACHOAujc-7dGUzMko4N3RaSFctWnI0UVJrUmcxNkE"
                >See here for a list of commonly used programs</a>, and their compatibility with
            Athena Ruby. </p>
        <p>There are roughly three ways to write documents using Athena Ruby:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a generic word processor along with a markup language. This method preserves the
                integrity of the underlying data, separates it from matters of style, and is best
                equipped to handle robust layout challenges (both in print and on screen). It is
                also the least familiar to scholars, and will come in use only gradually, as
                scholars get more familiar with XML, TeX, and related technologies. </li>
            <li>Use a program that uses advanced OpenType features. Because of the specialization of
                this type of software, this method is most suited to publishers.</li>
            <li>Use a decent word processor. This method will be very familiar to most users, but
                advanced features of Athena Ruby will rely upon non-Unicode data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each of these techniques are described below, beginning with the method most familiar
            (but least ideal), and concluding with least familiar (but most ideal).</p>
        <h3>Method C: A decent word processor</h3>
        <p>The most common word processors&mdash;Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, Google
            documents&mdash;are popular because they are powerful and easy to use. But the software
            companies that maintain these programs are selective in the typographic features they
            support. The advanced OpenType features used by Athena Ruby are usually poorly
            supported, if at all. Although these programs are not ideal for advanced typography,
            Athena Ruby has been designed to work with them. Variant letterforms and discretionary
            ligatures should be accessed not through their proper Unicode points but through the
            PUA. If you are using character finders and palettes (see above), you will find variant
            forms and ligatures toward the end (U+E100 onward). This method is not ideal because it
            generates text that cannot be read without the font. Because the text is not Unicode
            compliant, it cannot be reliably searched, sorted, or indexed. To make it Unicode
            compliant the text must be converted. </p>
        <p>This technique will be ideal for pdfs, word processing documents, and publications that
            do not require a high degree of professionalism.</p>
        <h3>Method B: Professional layout software</h3>
        <p>Less commonly used but more appropriate for professional publication are a small group of
            software programs that take advantage of OpenType features. These programs are
            specialized and require skill to use competently.</p>
        <p><strong>InDesign</strong> (Adobe), widely used by publishers, can take advantage of many
            of Athena Ruby's features. See <a href="AR ensemble.indd.zip">here for an example
                file</a>.</p>
        <p>Unicode text preservation results may vary. Text should remain Unicode compliant from
            start to end, although in some cases software may embed raw glyph IDs and not the
            underlying Unicode points. One needs to turn on discretionary ligatures and stylistic
            variants for the advanced OpenType features to work. In version 5.5 unusual behavior has
            been observed regarding complex decorations. In traversing a series of complex
            decorations, the cursor may erratically jump. It is unclear what creates this effect,
            since experiments with the same string in other programs do not produce the same
            results.</p>
        <p><strong>T<span
                    style="vertical-align: -0.5ex; margin-left: -0.1667em; margin-right: -0.125em;"
                    >E</span>X</strong> is a sophisticated typesetting system that uses text markup
            to take advantage of advanced typography. Special versions of TeX, notably XeTeX, are
            also equipped to access ligatures and variant letterforms in compliance with Unicode
            standards. An example of a TeX file is under development.</p>
        <p>Method B is ideal for generating more professional-looking pdfs than those generated
            under Method C, since the software programs provide subtle but important typographic
            finesse. There is also a greater chance that underlying Unicode data will be
            preserved.</p>
        <h3>Method A: An XML/HTML editor (plus markup)</h3>
        <p>The preferred method for getting the most out of Athena Ruby involves digital publishing
            that involves several stages. Those stages, very broadly, involve the following four
            interrelated steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marking up text</strong>. The text meant to be in Athena Ruby is typed in
                ordinary, plain text in a structured document, most commonly HTML, XML, or XHTML.
                Specific flavors of XML, such as TEI and EpiDoc, are good candidates, although a
                given schema may need some customization. The editor concerns him- or herself only
                with the text's Unicode values, not fonts. Those characters that should get special
                treatment in Athena Ruby are marked with unique, special tags, following the
                conventions that are standard for the structured language chosen. </li>
            <li><strong>Defining what the markup means</strong>. The markup codes chosen in the
                first stage are defined, to facilitate the next steps. The list of these definitions
                are usually part of a stylesheet. The markup language chosen will dictate the kind
                of stylesheet to used. For HTML and XHTML some form of CSS is most common. An XML
                project might rely on a companion XSLT, XML, or similar file.</li>
            <li><strong>Anticipating reading environments</strong>. One usually chooses a markup
                language with some sense of how the text should be read. An HTML file is meant for
                internet browsers. XML files are more flexible, and can be rendered into web pages,
                ordinary text documents, or even pdfs. One must decide which browsers, or even which
                devices, to support. Decisions here may affect previous steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Transforming the text documents</strong>. Once the previous three steps have
                been synchronized, a mechanism needs to be set up to take the marked up text (step
                1), coupled with the stylesheet (step 2), and generate files appropriate for the
                specified reading environments (step 3). If a web project, this could be done before
                files are uploaded to the server (e.g., static HTML files), or a server could make
                the transformations on the fly (i.e., server-side transformations), or files could
                be delivered to allow a reader's browser to make the transformation after the files
                are delivered (i.e., client-side transformations). If one intends other types of
                results, such as electronic publications (e.g., pdf, epub, mobi) one may wish to
                develop XSLT or XSL-FO files to facilitate the transformation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These four steps are usually negotiated concurrently, as an author or a team discovers
            methods that work best. Because the four steps require different skills and expertise,
            this method is especially conducive to collaborative teamwork.</p>
        <p>Users of this method will want to pay attention to the draft of <a
                href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/">CSS Fonts Module Level 3</a>, which is likely to set
            the standard for how to access and use advanced OpenType features.</p>
        <p>This method will be deployed most often in HTML-based projects, which are
            browser-dependent. But not all browsers are created equal. At the present, Firefox (PC
            or Mac) best supports Athena Ruby's advanced features. The best way to compare behavior
            is to open the <a href="ARdatabase.html">database</a> in different browsers.</p>

        <h2>Principles of glyph design</h2>
        <p>The glyphs in Athena Ruby were designed with two guiding principles. The first was our
            publishing legacy. The custom typography in Dumbarton Oaks books evolved over time, and
            the glyph types were used or abandoned according to the judgment of specific scholars.
            This trend reached a watershed with Nicholas Oikonomides, who pioneered the
            categorization and dating of letterforms in Byzantine seals. <span class="title">A
                Collection of Dated Byzantine Lead Seals</span> (Washington, D.C., 1986) introduced
            the world's first font for Byzantine inscriptions. This led to a number of other fonts
            developed specially in the 1990s for publications about seals, coins, and silver plate.
            We wished to consolidate and preserve that legacy, so the design intentionally conserves
            much of the aesthetic from Athena and older fonts.</p>
        <p>The second principle was our commitment to continue the conversation about Byzantine
            letterforms. We conservatively anticipated variants, ligatures, and designs that had not
            been included in our older fonts, but seemed especially useful, and noncontroversial, to
            distinguish as new types. Our focus was on seals, coins, weights. Some media, such as
            brick stamps, bread stamps, and frescoes, were not consulted as extensively.</p>
        <p>The glyphs in Athena Ruby are meant to evoke, but not replicate, types of letters.
            Authors who need to replicate exact letterforms not found in Athena Ruby should either
            augment the font on their own, or work with customized graphics and images.</p>
        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <p class="question">Why have you assigned characters to the Private Use Area (PUA) as you
            have? Why doesn't it coincide with the assignments found in other epigraphic fonts?</p>
        <p class="answer">True, other custom fonts with figures useful in Byzantine epigraphy, such
            as <a href="http://www.scholarsfonts.net/" rel="external" target="_new">Cardo</a>, <a
                class="external-link"
                href="http://www.ifao.egnet.net/publications/outils/polices/#grec">IFAOGrec
                Unicode</a>, <a class="external-link" href="http://junicode.sourceforge.net/"
                >Junicode</a>, and <a class="external-link"
                href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~pinax/greekkeys/NAUdownload.html">New Athena
                Unicode</a>, use PUA. We decided early on that we would not force Athena Ruby's use
            of the PUA to conform with that used by other epigraphic fonts. Each font has a
            different reason for populating and arranging glyphs in the PUA. In our case, most
            populated PUA codepoints are concessions, mirror images of properly placed,
            Unicode-compliant variant glyphs. In an ideal world, the R-shaped beta, very common in
            Byzantine seals, would be accessed by keying in U+0392 then accessing variant 1. But
            because most software programs do not allow a user to choose variant letterforms, we
            provided a copy of the glyph at U+E11B. This concessive use of the PUA applies to the
            first three subblocks (U+E100.., U+E300.., U+E400..). Subsequent blocks (U+E500..,
            U+E600.., U+E700..) have no corresponding Unicode point, and may never have one. Many of
            these proprietary codepoints are used in different ways in different disciplines, and
            there is no guarantee that the meanings imputed by users of Athena Ruby would hold true
            in other proprietary fonts. So assignments to the PUA have been made with attention only
            to users of Athena Ruby, to avoid giving the impression, that it is commensurate with
            other fonts.</p>
        <p class="answer">Nevertheless, it is true that there is some overlap. As documentation for
            Athena Ruby and other proprietary inscription fonts grow, and as consensus emerges in
            the field, there should be no obstactle either to finding new proposals for Unicode, or
            in furnishing a cross-walk protocol, to document which characters in various fonts' PUA
            blocks correspond to each other. Suggestions along this line can be made on the <a
                href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/athena-ruby">Athena Ruby
                Google group</a>.</p>
        <p class="question">Why don't you include other Greek Unicode characters such as the
            digamma, the sho, and the san?</p>
        <p class="answer">The font covers specifically 325 through 1453, so characters that were
            used before this time were not included.</p>
        <p class="question">I don't see a special character that I need. Could you create a new
            version of the font with these new forms?</p>
        <p class="answer">Dumbarton Oaks will officially add to the font only as our publishing
            needs grow, and even then only as scholars develop a consensus about letterform types.
            But this should not keep you from developing your own special glyphs, either as an
            extension to Athena Ruby or as a new font altogether. Under the <a rel="license"
                href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons License</a>
            users are required to share any modified forms of Athena Ruby. We hope the font
            encourages deeper study, conversation, and discoveries in the typology of Byzantine
            letterforms. But that task belongs to the scholarly community.</p>
        <p class="question">I already have a document that uses the previous Athena font. Is there a
            conversion tool I can use?</p>
        <p class="answer">A web-based conversion tool is under development.</p>
        <p class="question">Your database of letterforms is incomplete and incorrect. How do I
            supply corrections?</p>
        <p class="answer">Join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/athena-ruby">Athena
                Ruby discussion list</a> and pose the correction. Should participants react
            favorably to the suggestions, the errors will be corrected. Proposed new characters will
            be held in reserve until our publication needs justify the expense of introducing
            professionally drawn characters.</p>
        <p class="question">I'm setting up a web-based project, but the font isn't showing. What is
            wrong?</p>
        <p class="answer">Common problems include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your server has not been instructed to deliver certain types of files, such as woff,
                eot, and svg. The way to check this is to go to the URL bar of your browser and type
                exactly the URL of the font. It should download fine. If it doesn't or if there are
                error messages, your server's permissions are likely the cause. Check with your
                server and see if you can edit the file that regulates your mimetypes with text
                something similar to this:<br />
                <code>.eot&emsp;application/octet-stream<br />.otf&emsp;application/x-font-otf
                    <br />.svg&emsp;image/svg+xml<br />.woff&emsp;application/font-woff</code>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure your page declares itself to be UTF-8 through a tag such as <code>&lt;meta
                    http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" /&gt; </code></li>
        </ul>
